## 1. How long did you spend on the technical test?

About 4 hours - mostly wrestling with IntelliJ on a MacBook!

## 2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I think there could be some more common code and I'd like to spend some more time on the Schema validation as I'm not very happy with the solution I implemented.

Reporting woukld be another area and in a commercial environment would look to improve the feedback from the test reports.

##3. If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

There is potentially a case for implementing BDD through cucumber which I toyed with but for API based tests they often add overhead and complexity without value. If there was value to be gained then it could be implemented in a more BDD style approach.


##4. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

Write fewer tests! We spend a lot of time writitng tests that have little value and have a lot of duplication across the SDLC and so an interesting trend for me is to create tests where they add most benefit either UI/API/DB working alongside Unit/Component test coverage.

##5. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

I have done this in the past and I've looked at the key areas of risk to determine where to start writing tests. I think its difficult to write a huge number of tests  as you might if starting greenfield  so you are better off adding tests where the feedback would give most value.

You might also have to infer requirements from the actual operation of the system rather than spec as the documentation may be out of date or there is no swagger doc or similar for reference. In that case I'd doucment the actual behaviour with Exploratory Testing and agree with stakeholders and team to desired behaviour, raising tickets as required to work on.

##6. How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?

I don't use the Website too much as I mostly use the app (It's easier when wraggling a small child!) but my one experience was when I was allowed to place an order for a restaurant that was closed... Luckily someone actually phoned me up to arrange a refund so the customer experience was pretty good overall.
